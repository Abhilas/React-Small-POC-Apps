For Authentication we are using Google OAuth flow.

Client ID for 'StreamingVideos' is: 159037992567-c04of3mr7qijssdds60tocbk18oqt740.apps.googleusercontent.com

To use API we have to install the google API, since it is not permitted in company laptop we will just add the below script tag in the 'index.html' page.

<script src="https://apis.google.com/js/api.js"></script>
